Title: Fast Gene Set Entrichment Analysis
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: person("Alexey", "Sergushichev", email = "alsergbox@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The package implements an algorithm for fast gene set enrichment 
    analysis. Using the fast algorithm allows to make more permutations and
    get more fine grained p-values, which allows to use accurate stantard approaches 
    to multiple hypothesis correction.
